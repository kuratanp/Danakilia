### 1. The problem: What is the problem you wish to solve?
Danakilia cichlids are freshwater and benthopelagic fishes that habituate in Danakil Depression in Eritrea. Three species of Dabakilia chchlids have been sampled from various locations within the Danakil Depression. Genomics DNA was extracted from the samples and a double-digestion RAD dataset has been produced for further analyses. Though basic biological information about the species and geological history of the Danakil Depression are known, it is unclear as to how those populations represented by the sampled individuals are related to each other. In my course project, I will aim to learn various machine learning clustering methods, apply some appropriate methods to my dataset and gain more insight into the populations of the Danakilia cichlids. Here are the steps for the project: 1) learn and choose clustering methods appropriate for my dataset, 2) create a python program for converting ddRAD data into the appropriate format to be analyzed for machine learning, 3) apply clustering methods, 4) write a report in the Jupyter Notebook with regard to the methods I utilized and what worked best for my type of data.

### 2. The data: What is the data you will analyze and where is it from?
My double-digestion RAD dataset consists of six populations of Danakilia cichlids in the Danakil Depression of northeastern Africa, Eritrea; _Danakilia dinicolai_ from a crater lake Abaeded (ABA), and its congener species _D. franchettii_ from two springs flowing into Lake Afrera, Afrera ‘spring 3’ (AFR1) and Afrera ‘spring 8’ (AFR2), _Danakillia Sp._ from ephemeral rivers, Shukoray (SHU), Zariga (ZAR), Gali Colluli (GCO). Five specimens were included per population.

### 3. The tools: What computational tools will you use to solve the task?
I propose to use scikit-learn which offers various machine learning clustering methods. Potential clustering methods I may investigate are K-Means, Affinity propagation, Mean-shift, Spectral clustering, Ward hierarchical clustering, agglomerative clustering DBSCAN, Gaussian mixtures, and Birch.

### 4. The novelty: Why is this novel?
No previous studies have applied machine learning clustering methods to define population relationships of Danakilia cichlids.

### 5. The goal: What is your envisioned product at the due date and after?
My goals are to create a python program for converting my ddRAD data into the appropriate format to be analyzed for machine learning, and also produce visual data plots from different clustering methods to describe the population relationships of Danakilia cichlids. I will also produce a report of results after testing different methods in the Jupyter Notebook.
