### Code-Riview:

Three projects: 

* Nicolas Locatelli (mistergroot)
* Neha Savant (nehasavant)
* Vijay Ramesh (vjjan91)

 
__Question1: In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project were about? How to install it?  How to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?__

Nicolas Locatelli (mistergroot/VirtualDive) – The README file provides a short description about the project, but directions for installation and its use were not yet listed ( as of May 8, 2018). However,  his proposal file had great explanations of what the project was about.

Neha Savant (nehasavant) - The README file explains her detailed project summary and tools that she is planning to use. Directions for installation and its use were not yet listed. 

Vijay Ramesh (vjjan 91) – The README file clearly explained his project plans, and how to search his files. Installation was not available since the project in still in development.

__Question2: Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?__

Nicolas Locatelli (mistergroot/VirtualDive) - Python scripts were not yet posted.
Neha Savant (nehasavant) - Python scripts were not yet posted.
Vijay Ramesh (vjjan 91) – There was no project file in his repository.

__Question 3: Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?__

Nicolas Locatelli (mistergroot/VirtualDive) ––  A number of notebooks were provided in the directory. The notebooks have not been mentioned in the README file.  It was not clear as to which notebooks to look at since there was no direction provided in the README file yet, but it is clear that Nick has been working hard on the project! In the notebook called VirtualDrive, he demonstrated how to return records of “Scleractinia” using `Records` which was easily understood.

Neha Savant (nehasavant) – A notebook was provided in the directory, but it wasn't mentioned in the README file. She has an notebook showing how to run ipyrad with Eurycea longicauda samples. She explained clearly how she went about filtering her dataset.

Vijay Ramesh (vjjan 91) – The README file explains what files were in the notebook folder and also explains what he tried to do in those notebooks. His notebook called WebScraping.ipynb was easily understood and I was able to understand how he scrapped his data using the keyword “Western Ghats”.

__Question 4: Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?__

Nicolas Locatelli (mistergroot/VirtualDive) – Nicolas’ project is very interesting that he aims to create a python package that collects the data from PacIOOS and runs larval dispersal simulations using the GeoEco package. I am currently studying a riverine system in Africa, but I would like to look into some similar tools applicable to riverine systems.

Neha Savant (nehasavant) – Neha’s project is also very interesting. The problems with some of the machine learning clustering models (e.g. KMeans) are that they require pre-determined cluster numbers. Neha is planning to run the cluster analysis using STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) to determine a useful K value (cluster number). It will be interesting to compare a cluster results obtained from STRUCTURE with those from KMeans machine learning methods.

Vijay Ramesh (vjjan 91) – His project is very different from mine, however, I think his tool is very useful to run meta-analysis, which I might be interested in doing for my dissertation.
